\title{Test for Normality}
\usage{
censPPCC.test(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of left-censored observations, missing values are
removed before computation.}
}
\value{
An object of class "htest" having these components:

\item{statistic}{ the value of the test statistic.}
\item{p.value}{ the attained p-value for the test.}
\item{data.name}{ a character string describing the name of the data 
used in the test.}
\item{method}{ a description of the method.}
\item{alternative}{ a description of the null and alternate
hypotheses.}
}
\description{
Computes the probability plot correlation coefficient test for departures 
from normality for left-censored data.
}
\note{
The PPCC test is attractive because it has a simple, graphical
interpretation: it is a measure of the correlation in a Q-normal plot
of the uncensored data and is related to the Shapiro-Francia test for 
normality described by Royston (1993). The extension to multiple detection 
limit data is described in the help files in Millard (2001). The attained
p-value for multiple detection limit data is only approximate.
